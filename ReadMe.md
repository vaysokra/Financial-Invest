## Federal Reserve
     The Federal Reserve System (often shortened to the Federal Reserve, or simply the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States of America. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907).
     The federal funds rate describes the interest rate that banks charge other banks for lending them cash (typically excess monies on hand in their reserve balances)   on an overnight basis.
- ### when interest Rates are High = buy Bonds
     You'll get a great coupon that pays a lot interest
     When interest Rates decrease, the market price of a bond will increases.
- ### when interest Rates are low = buy Stock
     Find companies with very low debt, positive earnings, and a strong price to book ratio.
     Determine the intrinsic value and only pay a price below that figure.
